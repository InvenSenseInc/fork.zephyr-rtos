 * @brief Extended sensor attributes for ICM42670S 6-axis MEMS sensor

 * This exposes attributes for the ICM42670S which can be used for
 * setting the signal path filtering parameters.
 *
 * The signal path starts with ADCs for the gyroscope and accelerometer. 
 * Low-Noise Mode and Low-Power Mode options are available for the 
 * accelerometer. Only Low-Noise Mode is available for gyroscope.
 * In Low-Noise Mode, the ADC output is sent through an Anti-Alias Filter
 * (AAF). The AAF is a filter with fixed coefficients (not user configurable),
 * also the AAF cannot be bypassed. The AAF is followed by a 1st Order Low Pass 
 * Filter (LPF) with user selectable filter bandwidth options. 
 * In Low-Power Mode, the accelerometer ADC output is sent through an Average
 * filter, with user configurable average filter setting.
 * The output of 1st Order LPF in Low-Noise Mode, or Average filter in Low-Power
 * Mode is subject to ODR selection, with user selectable ODR.

/**
 * @brief Extended sensor channel for ICM42670S 6-axis MEMS sensor
 *
 * This exposes sensor channel for the ICM42670S which can be used for
 * getting the APEX features data.
 * 
 * The APEX (Advanced Pedometer and Event Detection â€“ neXt gen) features of 
 * ICM-42670-S consist of:
 * ** Pedometer: Tracks step count.
 * ** Tilt Detection: Detect the Tilt angle exceeds 35 degrees. 
 * ** Wake on Motion (WoM): Detects motion when accelerometer samples exceed 
 * a programmable threshold. This motion event can be used to enable device 
 * operation from sleep mode.
 * ** Significant Motion Detector (SMD): Detects significant motion based on
 * accelerometer data.
 *
 * This also exposes sensor channel for the ICM42670S which can be used for
 * getting the Air Motion Library (AML) data.
 *
 * The AML library provides pointing from ICM42670S 6-axis sensor and intended 
 * to be used in free space pointing devices to operate in-air point and click
 * navigation, just like a classic 2D mouse will do on a desk. The library 
 * additionally provides swipe motion recognition, gyroscope biases calibration
 * and quaternion orientation.
